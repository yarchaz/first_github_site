                helps him know what equipment to use on a job as some tools can become unsafe to handle.  Jeff also likes to plan weekend outings
                with his wife and daughter, so he really enjoys having a 10 day forecast to reference. He expects the information he needs to be easily
                accessible and viewable on any device. </p>

                home he uses his phone to check the weather.</p>
