                <p>Proximity is important if you want to convey that items on a page are related to each other. Items that go together should be placed on the page in such a way as to leave no question that they are related.
                I feel that TCG player does this well. Images are placed next to the adds they relate to. Descriptive text is next to their proper headings, and prices are located next to the items they belong to.

                <p>White space is key to a clean, organized design. To little white space makes your page look busy, and to much makes things look unconnected and hard to follow.
                I think xbox.com has found the right balance of white space on their site. All the elements are given room to breathe. Nothing feels cramped, and everything flows naturally as you scroll down the page.

                <h2>Hick's Law</h2>

                <p>Hick's Law states that, "With every additional choice there is an increase in the time required to make a decision." <br>
                The best example in my mind of sites that have too many decisions are shopping sites. There are thousands of items to choose from,
                and if there weren't any filters you would have a really hard time deciding what to get as you would have to look through the whole 
                database just to locate the type of item you want let alone the exact one you are looking for.
                </p>
                <p>To overcome this law, it is good design practice to incorporate <strong>filters</strong> into your website. This will reduce the number of choices 
                    and this in turn will reduce the time needed to decide. Which will make for a better experience for the users of the site. If the users are happy, they will keep coming back.
